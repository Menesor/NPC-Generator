# NPC-Generator
This application was designed to randomly generate npc's for use in tabletop rpgs. Included is an xml file that the program reads. You can add more to the list or remove stuff already in the list, as long as the structure remains the same. For example, you could add more races or names, but you can't get rid of the nationalities section altogether.

This program was developed using Visual Studio 2015.
